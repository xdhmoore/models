Notes on Object Detection Analysis Paper:


They studied effects of:
* occlusion
* size
* aspect ratio
* visibility of parts
* viewpoint
* localization error
* confusion with semantically similar objects
* confusion with obher labeled objects
* confusion with background

I think Figure 6 would go well wtih a modified version of that Nature paper graph - show the frequency (y-axis) of each characteristic subset (occluded vs not occluded) (x-axis)

How do I get the detection rank? Confidence score ranked?




Their MatLab code
Options
* Make graphs with matlab code
  * manually or with Labelbox tool create duplicate dataset in VOC format
  * Write matlab code to read in existing format?
    * matlab code to read in tf records?
    * matlab code to read in json and saved images?
* Make graphs using custom TF evaluator
  * copy some or all graph-making code using matlab as example?
* Try out existing evaluators to see if they do category-specific analysis
  like you want
